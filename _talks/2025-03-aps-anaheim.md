Presented our comprehensive computational study mapping the relationship between structural stability and superconducting properties in compressed sodium-intercalated graphite. This work identifies optimal pressure-composition conditions for enhanced superconductivity.

**Key Points Covered:**
- Complete pressure-composition phase diagram
- Electronic structure origins of enhanced Tc
- Guidance for experimental synthesis

**Audience:** Condensed matter physicists, superconductivity researchers
**Session:** Superconductivity: Theory and Computation
