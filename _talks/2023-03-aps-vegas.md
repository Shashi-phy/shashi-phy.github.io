Presented systematic first-principles investigation of the inverse Faraday effect across 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals, revealing fundamental trends and electronic mechanisms.

**Key Findings Presented:**
- Systematic trends across transition metal series
- Enhanced response in 5d metals due to spin-orbit coupling
- Electronic structure origins of light-induced magnetism

**Research Significance:** This work provides foundation for designing materials with enhanced optical magnetic control for ultrafast device applications.

**Session:** Light-Matter Interactions in Quantum Materials
