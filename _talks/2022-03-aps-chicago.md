Presented theoretical framework for understanding the inverse Faraday effect in nonmagnetic metals, including gauge-invariant formulation and separation of spin and orbital contributions.

**Theoretical Contributions:**
- Gauge-invariant theory development
- Role of spin-orbit coupling
- Connection to Berry curvature and electronic topology

**Applications:** Foundation for ultrafast magnetic switching and optical control of magnetism.

**Collaboration:** Work conducted at UC Riverside with Prof. Sinisa Coh.
