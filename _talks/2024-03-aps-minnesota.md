Presented groundbreaking work on implementing vertex corrections beyond the standard Migdal approximation for electron-phonon interactions in superconductors, with applications to high-Tc hydrides.

**Session Chair Role:** Also served as Session Chair for "Electrons, Phonons, and Electron-Phonon Scattering" session.

**Research Highlights:**
- First implementation of vertex corrections in EPW code
- Significant corrections to superconducting properties in H‚ÇÉS
- New theoretical framework for beyond-Migdal calculations

**Impact:** This work opens new frontiers in computational superconductivity for high-Tc materials.
