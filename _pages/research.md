My research focuses on developing advanced theoretical and computational methods to understand quantum many-body phenomena in condensed matter systems, with emphasis on electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity, and topological materials.

## Current Research Projects

### Beyond Migdal Approximation in Superconductivity
I am developing first-order vertex corrections for electron-phonon interactions that go beyond the conventional Migdal approximation, enabling more accurate predictions of superconducting properties in high-Tc hydrides.
