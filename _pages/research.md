My research focuses on developing advanced theoretical and computational methods to understand quantum many-body phenomena in condensed matter systems, with emphasis on electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity, and topological materials.

## Current Research Projects

*Beyond Migdal approximation in superconductivity:* Developing first-order vertex corrections for electron-phonon interactions that go beyond the conventional Migdal approximation, enabling more accurate predictions of superconducting properties in high-Tc hydrides.

## Research Themes

- *Quantum many-body theory:* Developing advanced theoretical frameworks to capture non-adiabatic effects and vertex corrections in strongly coupled electron-phonon systems. Investigating unconventional superconducting mechanisms in high-Tc materials and the interplay between electron correlations and phonon dynamics.
