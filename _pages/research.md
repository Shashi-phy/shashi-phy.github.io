My research focuses on developing advanced theoretical and computational methods to understand quantum many-body phenomena in condensed matter systems, with particular emphasis on electron-phonon interactions and their role in superconductivity.

## Current Research Projects

### Beyond Migdal Approximation in Superconductivity

I am developing first-order vertex corrections for electron-phonon interactions that go beyond the conventional Migdal approximation. This work enables more accurate predictions of superconducting properties in systems such as high-Tc hydrides where conventional adiabatic theories break down.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed theoretical framework for vertex corrections in H₃S
- Implemented computational methods in EPW code
- Demonstrated significant corrections to superconducting properties

### Transport Properties of Topological Materials

Investigating electron-phonon limited transport in Weyl semimetals and other topological materials, focusing on how Berry phase effects influence conductivity and anomalous transport phenomena.

**Current Focus:**
