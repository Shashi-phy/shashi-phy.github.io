I use first-principles simulations, many-body theory, and data-driven models to design superconductors and quantum materials. My work connects fundamental electron-phonon physics with practical routes for controlling transport and light-matter interactions.

## Research Focus

- *Superconductivity* — Phonon-mediated pairing, vertex corrections, and materials design for ambient pressure superconductivity.
- *Topological transport* — Berry curvature driven responses, transport propertis of Weyl/Dirac semimetals, and emergent superconducting states in topological platforms.
- *Light-Matter interaction* — Ultrafast excitation, inverse Faraday effect, and non-thermal phase transition in materials.
- *Automated workflows* — Machine learning models for Tc prediction, ML-ready datasets for electron-phonon coupling.
- *Magnetism* - Acheiving through intercalation of diatomic molecules between 2D materials.
- *Energy storage devices* - Explored Si$_2$BN, Graphdiyne, and Graphyne for solid-state batteries. 
- *Catalysis* - Semiconducting oxides and their heterointerfaces for catalytic applications.

## Methods Snapshot

- Density-functional and many-body perturbation techniques for realistic electron-phonon physics
- High-throughput workflows linking stability, transport, and superconducting observables
- Lightweight ML models that accelerate screening while keeping interpretability front and center
