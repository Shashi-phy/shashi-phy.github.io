I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist working at the intersection of quantum many-body theory, computational materials science, and machine learning. Currently, I focus on pushing the boundaries of electron-phonon physics by developing methodologies that go beyond the Migdal approximation. These efforts enable more accurate predictions of superconducting properties in systems such as high-Tc hydrides where conventional adiabatic theories break down.

## Current Position

**Postdoctoral Researcher** (April 2023 - Present)  
Department of Physics, SUNY Binghamton, NY, USA  
Advisor: Prof. Roxana Margine

- Developing first-order vertex corrections for electron-phonon interactions beyond Migdal approximation
- Implementing machine learning approaches to accelerate superconductor discovery
- Contributing to EPW (Electron-Phonon Wannier) code development
- Investigating transport properties of Weyl Semimetals

## Previous Position

**Postdoctoral Researcher** (April 2021 - March 2023)  
Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA  
Advisor: Prof. Sinisa Coh

- Formulated gauge-invariant theory for inverse Faraday effect in nonmagnetic metals
- Investigated light-induced magnetic phenomena for ultrafast magnetic switching applications
- Developed theoretical framework for optical control of magnetism
- Collaborated on experimental validation of theoretical predictions

## Research Focus

I am interested in integrating machine learning with first-principles calculations to accelerate the discovery of materials with tunable quantum properties, especially for transport and superconductivity applications. My research emphasizes bridging fundamental physics with real-world applications that include:

- **Design of quantum materials** for next-generation computing
- **Light-induced magnetism** for ultrafast devices  
- **Materials for sustainable energy storage**

## Research Interests

**Quantum Many-Body Theory**: Phonon-mediated superconductivity, electron-phonon interactions, vertex corrections, strongly correlated systems

**Superconductivity**: High-Tc cuprates, iron-based superconductors, nickelates, superconducting mechanisms beyond BCS theory

**Topological Quantum Matter**: Topological superconductivity, Weyl and Dirac semimetals, topological phase transitions, quantum anomalous Hall effect

**Transport Properties**: Electron-phonon limited transport, Berry phase effects on conductivity, anomalous transport in topological materials, ultrafast carrier dynamics

**Machine Learning for Materials Physics**: ML-accelerated discovery of phonon-mediated superconductors, neural network potentials for electron-phonon coupling, data-driven approaches for predicting critical temperatures
