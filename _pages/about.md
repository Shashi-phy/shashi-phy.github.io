I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist working at the intersection of quantum many-body theory, computational materials science, and machine learning. Currently, I focus on pushing the boundaries of electron-phonon physics by developing methodologies that go beyond the Migdal approximation. These efforts enable more accurate predictions of superconducting properties in systems such as high-Tc hydrides where conventional adiabatic theories break down.

## Research Interests

**Quantum Many-Body Theory**: Phonon-mediated superconductivity, electron-phonon interactions, vertex corrections, strongly correlated systems

**Superconductivity**: High-Tc cuprates, iron-based superconductors, nickelates, superconducting mechanisms beyond BCS theory

**Topological Quantum Matter**: Topological superconductivity, Weyl and Dirac semimetals, topological phase transitions, quantum anomalous Hall effect

**Transport Properties**: Electron-phonon limited transport, Berry phase effects on conductivity, anomalous transport in topological materials, ultrafast carrier dynamics

**Machine Learning for Materials Physics**: ML-accelerated discovery of phonon-mediated superconductors, neural network potentials for electron-phonon coupling, data-driven approaches for predicting critical temperatures
