I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist at SUNY Binghamton using first-principles simulations, many-body theory, and data-driven models to design superconductors and quantum materials. My work connects fundamental electron-phonon physics with practical routes for controlling transport and light-matter interactions.

## Research Focus

- **Quantum superconductivity** — Phonon-mediated pairing, vertex corrections, and mechanisms that go beyond weak-coupling BCS pictures.
- **Topological transport** — Berry curvature driven responses, Weyl/Dirac semimetals, and emergent superconducting states in topological platforms.
- **Photon- and phonon-engineering** — Ultrafast excitation, inverse Faraday effect, and phonon-limited mobility in quantum devices.
- **Machine-learning design loops** — Surrogate models for Tc prediction, ML-ready datasets, and neural-network potentials for electron-phonon coupling.

## Methods Snapshot

- Density-functional and many-body perturbation techniques for realistic electron-phonon physics
- High-throughput workflows linking stability, transport, and superconducting observables
- Lightweight ML models that accelerate screening while keeping interpretability front and center

## Education
