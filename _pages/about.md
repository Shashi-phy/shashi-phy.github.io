I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist at SUNY Binghamton working on superconductivity, topological materials, electron-phonon interactions, and light-matter interactions. I develop and apply first-principles computational methods, machine learning approaches, and many-body theory to design and discover functional quantum materials.

## Research Interests

- *Quantum many-body theory:* Phonon-mediated superconductivity, electron-phonon interactions, vertex corrections, strongly correlated systems

- *Superconductivity:* High-Tc cuprates, iron-based superconductors, nickelates, superconducting mechanisms beyond BCS theory

- *Topological quantum matter:* Topological superconductivity, Weyl and Dirac semimetals, topological phase transitions, quantum anomalous Hall effect

- *Transport properties:* Electron-phonon limited transport, Berry phase effects on conductivity, anomalous transport in topological materials, ultrafast carrier dynamics

- *Machine learning for materials physics:* ML-accelerated discovery of phonon-mediated superconductors, neural network potentials for electron-phonon coupling, data-driven approaches for predicting critical temperatures
