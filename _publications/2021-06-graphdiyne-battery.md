We propose graphdiyne as a novel cathode material for aluminum ion batteries through comprehensive first-principles calculations, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional materials.

**Key Achievements:**
- High theoretical capacity and voltage
- Low diffusion barriers for Al³⁺ ions
- Excellent structural stability during cycling
- Detailed mechanism of ion intercalation

**Impact:**
This work opens new avenues for designing 2D materials for next-generation battery technologies and sustainable energy storage.

**PhD Research:**
This represents key research from my doctoral studies at IIT Madras under Prof. B. R. K. Nanda.
