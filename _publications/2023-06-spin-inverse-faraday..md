We develop a gauge-invariant theoretical framework for understanding the spin contribution to the inverse Faraday effect in nonmagnetic metals, providing fundamental insights into light-induced magnetism.

**Theoretical Advances:**
- Gauge-invariant formulation of inverse Faraday effect
- Separation of orbital and spin contributions
- Connection to Berry curvature and electronic topology

**Physical Insights:**
- Role of spin-orbit coupling in light-induced magnetization
- Material design principles for enhanced optical magnetic control
- Foundation for ultrafast magnetic switching applications

**Collaboration:**
This work was conducted during postdoctoral research at UC Riverside in collaboration with Prof. Sinisa Coh.
