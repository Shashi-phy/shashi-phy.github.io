We present the first implementation of first-order vertex corrections to electron-phonon interactions in the high-temperature superconductor H₃S, going beyond the standard Migdal approximation used in conventional calculations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Development of vertex correction methodology in EPW code
- Significant corrections to superconducting properties
- New insights into non-adiabatic effects in hydrides

**Technical Achievement:**
This work represents a major advancement in computational superconductivity, enabling more accurate predictions for high-Tc materials where conventional theories fail.

**Code Development:**
Implementation is being integrated into the EPW (Electron-Phonon Wannier) code for community use.
