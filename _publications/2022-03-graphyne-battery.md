We propose graphyne as a superior anode material for aluminum-ion batteries through comprehensive DFT calculations, demonstrating exceptional performance with minimal volume expansion and ultralow diffusion barriers.

**Key Achievements:**
- Lowest volume expansion (< 5%) among 2D anode materials
- Ultra-low Al³⁺ diffusion barriers (0.15 eV)
- High theoretical capacity (496 mAh/g)
- Excellent structural stability during cycling

**Innovation:**
First systematic study of graphyne for Al-ion battery applications, opening new directions for 2D material battery design.
