We present a comprehensive computational study of superconductivity in compressed sodium-intercalated graphite, mapping the relationship between structural stability and superconducting properties across pressure and composition space.

**Research Highlights:**
- Complete pressure-composition phase diagram
- Identification of optimal superconducting phases with enhanced Tc
- Electronic structure analysis revealing mechanisms for superconductivity enhancement
- Guidance for experimental synthesis of high-Tc phases

**Methodology:**
Combined DFT structural optimization with EPW electron-phonon calculations to predict superconducting properties.
