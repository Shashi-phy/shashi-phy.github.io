We present a comprehensive first-principles study of electron-phonon limited transport properties in the archetypal Weyl semimetal TaAs, revealing unique transport signatures arising from the topological nature of the electronic bands.

**Key Results:**
- Detailed analysis of electron-phonon scattering in topological bands
- Berry curvature effects on transport coefficients
- Temperature-dependent resistivity and mobility calculations

**Significance:**
This work provides fundamental understanding of transport in Weyl semimetals and guidance for interpreting experimental transport measurements in topological materials.

**Equal Contribution:**
This work represents equal contributions from Z. Liu and S. B. Mishra in developing the theoretical framework and computational implementation.
