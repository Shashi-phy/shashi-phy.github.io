This work presents a systematic first-principles investigation of the inverse Faraday effect in transition metals across the 3d, 4d, and 5d series. We demonstrate significant variations in the magnetic response to circularly polarized light and provide insights into the underlying electronic mechanisms.

**Key Findings:**
- Systematic trends across transition metal series
- Enhanced response in 5d metals due to strong spin-orbit coupling
- Electronic structure origins of the inverse Faraday effect

**Research Impact:**
This work provides fundamental understanding of light-induced magnetism that could enable next-generation ultrafast magnetic devices and optical control of magnetism.
